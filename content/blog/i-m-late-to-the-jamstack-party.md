It turns out my new found [fascination with decentralized websites](http://ryancampbell.blog/blog/getting-started/) isn't specific to them being decentralized. The movement of static sites has a place on the current web too -- [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org). For the past year people have been researching ways to take away the traditional centralized back end, and it's pretty neat.

A good starting point is to read about the [sweetness of JAMStack](	https://thenewstack.io/the-sweetness-of-jamstack-javascript-apis-and-markup/) and then get excited about the possibilities. Once you're excited, then get sad about the limitations. Fortunately, people are thinking outside of the box about certain problems:

[A Comment System](	https://thenewstack.io/the-sweetness-of-jamstack-javascript-apis-and-markup/): This shows how something dynamic like contents may work on a blog with no database. The solution is a bit messy right now, but you can see the potential. It's also refreshing to try and look at these problems from a completely new angle.

[Website Search](https://forestry.io/blog/search-with-algolia-in-hugo/): This solution is much more elegant, and there is nothing stopping me from adding it right now. Hmm, maybe I should get to work?

[WebDB](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/webdb): The Beaker folks have written WebDB as a way to manage data in the decentralized world. I have no opinion on this yet, but it looks promising enough to build a test app with.

I'm not sure if I like new things because I like change, or if it is because they're actually game changing. Either way, it's fun to follow.
