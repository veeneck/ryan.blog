I now have 4 side projects in motion along with personal tasks like finance and communication. For the first time, my go to workspace solution of mission control and spaces doesn't cut it. Between Xcode, multiple terminal windows running, Photoshop, Mail, Photos, Sketch, and so on I finally felt overwhelmed. It's time for a new solution.

I'm sure plenty of people have scripts to handle common tasks, but I've never needed it. Jumping from one project to the next has been a couple of windows at most. But, in this new web development world, [things get complicated fast](http://ryancampbell.blog/blog/a-lot-changes-in-six-years/). So, I wanted a solution that would close all windows, and reopen the relevant windows to exact positions in specific spaces with one keystroke. I was hoping [Workspaces](http://www.apptorium.com/workspaces) would do the trick, but it does not have enough features. So, I rolled my own with automator. Final product below:
