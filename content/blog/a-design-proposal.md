I've been working with a local charity to revamp their website. This has been a good project for me for a few reasons. First, as a coder, this gives me a chance to workout some design muscles. Second, as someone who normally answers only to myself, this gives me a chance to pitch to a group and understand their needs and wishes.

That said, I recently gave them a first proposal. This came about once they officially asked for a new website. Now, I got inspired, and ran with an idea. This is prior to any meetings defining goals. Because of that, there is a good chance that the design and/or brand is not exactly what they're looking for. Still, I'm documenting it here so that I can look back.

I started messing around with a logo, and became a bit inspired by a cutout look.

As a neat added plus, the logo would change colors depending on what background it is on.

Moving forward, that led to a smaller version of the logo.

Sure, 4 squares is nothing original. It is clean though, and since this is for a local charity a strong unique brand doesn't have to be established.
