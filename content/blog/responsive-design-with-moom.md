I just used these sizes: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21574881/responsive-design-with-media-query-screen-size](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21574881/responsive-design-with-media-query-screen-size "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21574881/responsive-design-with-media-query-screen-size") but you can use what works for you. I know response isn't meant to be hardcoded to a width, this is just good reference points.
