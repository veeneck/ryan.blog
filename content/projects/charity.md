Amanda and I have a goal of becoming more involved over the next two years. I'll continue to update this space documenting the types of contributions we can make.

### Expertise

Can we offer design and hosting services? Do websites matter for small, local charities? What sort of traffic do they get. Can meaningful donations be funnel through the site? Do online stores for swag work? Do event organization online work, or is it easier through Facebook?

First attempt at helping: [A first design proposal for their website.](https://ryancampbell.blog/blog/a-design-proposal/)

Next: [A second design proposal](https://ryancampbell.blog/blog/a-second-design-proposal/).

### Fundraising

How often can you ask parents and neighbors for money? What sorts of events work best?

### Donations

There are plenty of great reasons to donate. How do we choose? How do we know where the money goes?

### Time

Volunteer for existing projects. What does it involve to become a volunteer? How to stay updated? Are there mailing lists, etc?
