<h1>😉 Hey There.</h1>
<p>You've stumbled across my site. I'm Ryan. I'm a husband, father, programmer, runner, gamer and a lot of other er's. I use this site to organize my projects and write down some thoughts. Feel free to follow along, or <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a> if needed.</p><br />

<h1>💻 I'm Working On.</h1>

<p>I'm probably working on a lot more than I've completed. Head over to my <a href="/projects">projects</a> for a complete history. My last successful project was <a href="/projects/wufoo/">Wufoo</a>. These days, I've been working on a <a href="/projects/battleofbrothers/">mobile game</a>, <a href="/projects/shuffled/">photo wall</a>, <a href="/projects/blog/">web technology</a> and <a href="/projects/charity/">charity work.</a></p>

<p>Of course, before all of that, I'm trying to be the best dad I can be.</p><br />

<h1>💭 And Thinking About.</h1>

<p>Browse through my <a href="/blog">posts</a> or subscribe to <a href="index.xml">my feed</a> for direct access to my brain. Or, for immediate satisfaction, here is the latest:</p>

{{ if isset .Site.Params "latestpostcount" }}
      <div class="posts">
      {{ $nbPosts := len (where .Data.Pages "Section" "blog") }}
      {{ if gt $nbPosts 0 }}
          <ul>
          {{ range (first .Site.Params.latestpostcount (where .Pages "Section" "blog")).GroupByDate "Jan, 2006" "desc" }}
              {{ range sort .Pages "Date" "desc" }}
                  <li class="post-item">
                    <span class="meta">{{ .Date.Format "Jan 2" }}</span>
                    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}"><span>{{ .Title }}</span></a>
                  </li>
              {{ end }}
          {{ end }}
          </ul>
      {{ end }}
      </div>
  {{ end }}

What else will you find here? I've written about <a href="/tags/charity/">Charity</a>, <a href="">Game Development</a>, <a href="/tags/decentralized/">Decentralized Web</a>, <a href="">Life</a>, and <a href="/blog/">other topics</a>. Writing has been a good way for me to learn about a topic, so I continue to do it for that purpose.
